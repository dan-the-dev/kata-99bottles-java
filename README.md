## Instructions
Complete the function that returns the lyrics for the song 99 Bottles of Beer as an array of strings: each line should be a separate element - see the example at the bottom.

### Lyrics
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

...and so on...

3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

Example
`"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.",
"Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.",
"98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.",

...and so on...

"3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.",
"Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.",
"2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.",
"Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.",
"1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.",
"Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.",
"No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.",
"Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall." `

# Setup

Currently, Java kata template is not Dockerized - opening the cloned repository folder with IntelliJ should be enough - 
then simply use IntelliJ to run the tests via interface (Play button in the test class)

NB: if you can help in Dockerizing the template, feel free to help please! :)
